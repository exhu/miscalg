 *
 * These operations may or may not actually be implemented using processor
 * specific atomic operations. When possible they are implemented as true
 * processor specific atomic operations. When that is not possible the are

/**
 * Insert a memory release barrier (macro version).
 *
 * Memory barriers are designed to prevent reads and writes from being
 * reordered by the compiler and being seen out of order on multi-core CPUs.
 *
 * A typical pattern would be for thread A to write some data and a flag, and
 * for thread B to read the flag and get the data. In this case you would
 * insert a release barrier between writing the data and the flag,
 * guaranteeing that the data write completes no later than the flag is
 * written, and you would insert an acquire barrier between reading the flag
 * and reading the data, to ensure that all the reads associated with the flag
 * have completed.
 *
 * In this pattern you should always see a release barrier paired with an
 * acquire barrier and you should gate the data reads/writes with a single
 * flag variable.
